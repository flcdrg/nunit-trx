Console Runner for NUnit that generates TRX-format XML output.

Designed to be used in the same way (argument-compatible) as nunit-console.exe, it generates .trx files as the report output. These files are suitable for viewing within Visual Studio or attaching to a TFS build.

Features of nunit-trx include:

  * Setting test start/end times and duration
  * Including test console and trace outputs

NUnit-Trx is built upon and uses [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org)
